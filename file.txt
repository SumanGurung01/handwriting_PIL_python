In the year 280, in a town in Cappadocia, was born that great soldier and champion of the oppressed whom we call St. George. His parents were Christians, and by them, and especially by his mother, he was most carefully instructed and trained.

When the youth came to the age of seventeen years he took up the profession of arms, and since he was gifted with beauty of person, intelligence, and an exquisite courtesy, he rose rapidly to a considerable military rank. Especially he pleased his imperial master, Diocletian.

One day while the Emperor, who was devoted to the worship of Apollo, was consulting at a shrine of that god upon an affair of much importance, from the dark depths of the cavern came forth a voice saying, The just who are on the earth keep me from telling the truth. By them the inspiration of the Sacred Tripod is made a lie. At once the Emperor was stricken with consternation and asked who these just people were. Master, answered one of the priests of Apollo, they are the Christians. This answer so enraged Diocletian that he rekindled his persecutions.
